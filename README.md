## Installation

To get started, you'll need to install Java and the JMeter tool.

First, visit the Java website (https://www.oracle.com/br/java/technologies/downloads/) to download the Java JDK. You can create an account and download it from there.

Once you have installed Java, you can download JMeter from the official website (https://jmeter.apache.org/).
